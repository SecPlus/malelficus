MAL ELF ICUS
==========

Malelficus is a project maintained by the SEC+ hackers. Its main goal
is improve the knowledge about malwares for unix-like operating
systems and provides a set of API and tools designed to malware
analysis and development.

Below is a list of projects that are part of malelficus:

* [libmalelf](https://github.com/SecPlus/libmalelf) - C library to ELF analysis.
* [malelf](https://github.com/SecPlus/malelf) - Software used to create, view, modify and infect ELF
  binaries.
* [malelfgui](https://github.com/SecPlus/malelfgui) - Graphical User Interface to ELF edit.

Why malelficus?
==========

We know how malware is a serious problem on Windows OS, but why this
ignored on unix-like operating systems? Any answer to this question is doubtful.
The linux kernel has nothing about malware security on userspace, the same for BSD (FreeBSD, OpenBSD, etc).

Are you sure that your unix-servers are malware-free?

How do you know that has no backdoor if you are not running any antivirus on the servers?

You know that the majority of AV available for linux seek for Windows viruses? Not unix viruses?

Malelficus is just a research in this dark land.
